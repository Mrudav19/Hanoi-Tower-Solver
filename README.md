Hanoi Tower Solver Implementation

I implemented a Hanoi Tower solver in Python, offering both depth-first search (DFS) and A* search algorithms to find the optimal solution. Here's an overview of the key components and functionalities:

1. HanoiTowerNode Class:
   - Represents a state of the Hanoi Tower puzzle, including the configuration of disks on pegs.
   - Supports methods for generating child nodes, checking goal states, and calculating heuristics.

2. HanoiTowerSearch Class:
   - Facilitates depth-first search (DFS) and A* search algorithms to find solutions efficiently.
   - Implements methods for traversing the search space and finding optimal paths.

3. Search Algorithms:
   - Depth-first search (DFS) explores states exhaustively, prioritizing depth-first traversal.
   - A* search combines depth and heuristic information to efficiently explore promising paths first.

4. Solution Retrieval and Output:
   - Retrieves and prints the optimal solution path, including each step and corresponding disk configurations.
   - Calculates and displays the number of steps required to solve the Hanoi Tower puzzle.
   - Measures and reports the execution time for each search algorithm.

5. User Interaction:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface with informative messages and prompts.
   - Outputs the initial and goal states of the puzzle for clarity and context.

This implementation showcases my proficiency in algorithm design, problem-solving, and Python programming. It demonstrates efficient search strategies for solving complex puzzles and offers insights into the performance of different search algorithms.
